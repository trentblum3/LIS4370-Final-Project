# LIS4370-Final-Project
Final Project for R Programming LIS4370

The goal of my project is to predict how many runs a baseball team will score in a season given partial amounts of data. So a prediction model for how well a team will perform.

My project consists of 3 functions.

Calculate Stats is used to find advanced stats of any individual baseball player like Slugging Percentage, On Base Percentage, and On Base Plus Slugging Percentage should the dataset you use not provide those.

Calculate Runs will calculate how many runs your team should have scored over a given period, either a partial season or a complete season.

Predict Runs will predict how many runs a team will score over a full 162 game season, given partial seasons' results.

Predictive OPS, Predictive Runs, and Current Season OPS model are independent measurements I did and don't involve the three previously mentioned functions.
